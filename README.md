# FireImageSegmentation
This image segmentation dataset is generated automatically directly from class-level labels as a part of our project DeepSegmentation. In this project, we aim to speed up building pixel-level segmentation datasets without requiring domain expertise. The only required information is class-level labeled data, which is much easier to collect as compared with pixel-level segmented data.

The Developed model is stored in UNetW.h5. The code for the same is available in the Firedatasegmentaion.ipynb file.
The dataset can be downloaded from the following link from Kaggle.
